# 🛒 Shopping Cart - JavaScript Course Project

This project is part of a JavaScript course where we implemented the functionality of a shopping cart on a web page. The goal is for users to be able to add courses to a virtual cart and visualize them, as well as remove any unwanted courses.

## 🚀 Features

The implemented features in the shopping cart are:

- Add courses to cart: Users can select one or multiple courses from a list and add them to the shopping cart with a button.
- View cart: On the cart page, users can see the courses they've added, along with their respective prices and quantities.
- Remove courses: Users can remove courses from the cart with a delete button.
